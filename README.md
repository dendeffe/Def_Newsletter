### IMPORTANT ###

This is very much a work in progress. I advise to only use it to test it out at the moment.
It works but needs some more work to get it to a 0.1 status.

Also note that I am thinking of changing the way the module works. With a custom backend interface instead of using pages in the sitetree.
